Go to [How to Grade in Learning Suite.md](/resources/How-to-Grade-in-Learning-Suite.md) 
to see how to get to the grader and begin grading. 

Note: "-3" means subtract three points.

# Lab 6:

```1) Paste your Arduino code below:```
- 0 points if they didn't submit any code. Email or message them requesting it.
  - -5 points if they send the code. 
- -10 if they don’t have code for the range finder (check isCollision())
- -10 if they don’t have the code for the servo (check their state machines)
- -10 if the code obviously doesn't work. 

```2) Paste a link to your video below: (35 points)```
- 0 points if you can’t see the video. Add the comment:
  > Your video is not public. Please email me (insert TA email here) with a new link to the video and I will grade it. (With a -3 point deduction).
  - -3 points if they resend the video.
- 0 points if you can't see their name on the breadboard. Add the comment:
  > Your video does not have a name on the breadboard. Please email me (insert TA email here) with a new link a new video and I will grade it. (With a -3 point deduction).
  - -3 points if they send a new video, although if the original video would have had a lower score then give them that score.
- If their video is sus (you're not sure it's their own work) then ask the grading TA what to do. 
##### Video Rubric:
This video should show a fully functional light-following robot that demonstrates it's full capabilities. 
- 0 points for no name on the breadboard (see above).
- -3 points if the robot is propped up
- -3 if sloppy wiring
- -3 points (each) if they miss one of the following
  - Drive Left
  - Drive Right
  - Servo Up
  - Servo Down
  - (301) Stopping for collisions
  - (240) Turning for collisions (can be the full 90 degrees or just a turn until it stops seeing a collision)
- -3 points if they are running their robot connected to the computer
- -3 points if no talking explanation of how it works.
- -3 points mentioned above for having to request permission for the video. 

```3) <ECEn 240 only>  Add your lab report here (PDF only).```
- For 301: Give them the same points here as you gave them for Question 10.
- For 240: Use the rubric on [Learning Suite](https://learningsuite.byu.edu/.YoSI/cid-d8RgIfkKFPjI/student/pages/page/id-vIiK) ([download](https://learningsuite.byu.edu/plugins/Upload/fileDownload.php?fileId=f7dfd05e-fpKi-a1kw-5SBC-52ec5754a070)) to assess the quality of the lab report. 
  - Note: Most 240 lab reports should get full points as long as they put in effort, it looks professional, and they included most of or all the diagrams.
  - -3 for each item missing from the [list on the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/179IEi2TGgbwu7aiGNaS6mono3YWzSwouteQAAfrAf-4/edit#slide=id.g2e4be138e76_44_0). Some bullets include multiple items, like the 5 oscope PWM measurements.
  - TODO: specify on the lab slides rubric that the assignment on [slide 19](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/179IEi2TGgbwu7aiGNaS6mono3YWzSwouteQAAfrAf-4/edit#slide=id.g18a03179e30_1_783) should be included. -3 if they don't include an answer to that assignment, which is to identify the operating voltage, current, and distance the range finder works on.  
- -3 if it's not a pdf and it's after the first lab. 

```4) In what ways could this lab be improved? (extra credit)```

This usually grades automatically, but people often put “nothing” or something of the sort. Please check this and make sure it is right.  
- -1 point if they do not answer it with some real feedback.
